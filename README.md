INTRODUCTION AND CAPABILITIES
Digital PictureFrame is a Windows only application that enables you to view your digital photos and videos on a television screen or monitor. With it, you are in control of how and what gets displayed and have capabilities that other digital content viewers lack, such as:
* file support for jpg, gif, mp4, png
* image zooming
* adding metadata to images
* rotate video and images
* setting how long to display photos and videos
* temporarily hiding (or unhiding) photos you have marked as sensitive 
* creating multiple playlists of photos and videos
* supporting a multilevel folder structure so that you can better organize your digital content and more easily customize playlists (many other applications/devices require a single level or folder of content) specifying how many photos and videos to show from each folder, which allows you to have the desired sample of items displayed before moving to another folder, such as 5 images from Croatia, 5 images from your child’s 5th birthday party, 5 images from the 2024 work holiday party, and so on
* ensuring that no digital item repeats until all are shown (in random order) from the active playlist, so that you have the opportunity to actually see all your desired content and not just the same items over and over again
* using any device’s browser, such as Safari on an iPhone, to control your digital content display and change settings
* Voice control of basic functions, requires a seperate installation of hte MSVC runtime from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-supported-redistributable-version
